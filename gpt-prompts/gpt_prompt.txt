Extract all the concepts from the text beginning with [[START]] and ending in [[END]] into a JSON list of consisting of concept phrases present in the text. Also provide an explanation of why the concepts chosen are concepts. A concept is either one of the document's key takeaways or a term that is essential for expressing the document's key takeaways. Do not list administrative terms as concepts. When considering to take a phrase as a concept, answer the following questions:
1. Is it a defined term?
2. Is it used repeatedly in the text more than 2 times?
3. Is it extensively focused on?
4. Is it a noun or noun phrase?
5. Is it an abbreviation of a previously labeled concept?
6. Is it a variant form of a concept phrase?
7. Is it an administrative term? That is, is it only related to how the course is operated, and not the content of the course? Announcements, Homeworks, Exams and Labs are administrative too.

A valid response should only be a JSON list of concepts.

[[START]]

[[END]]

Review the list to make consider administrative terms as concepts. Remember to separate the terms enclosed in parentheses. Finally, put it in a JSON list, like this: ["apples", "cherries"]
